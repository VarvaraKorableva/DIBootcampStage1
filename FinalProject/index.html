          "Pornofilmy" is a Russian punk rock band from the city of Dubna, founded in 2008. 
          Currently, the lineup of "Pornofilmy" includes vocalist and lyricist Vladimir Kotlyarov, 
          guitarist Igor Rybin, guitarist and band manager Alexander Rusakov, drummer Kirill Muravyov, 
          and bassist Alexander Agafonov.

          The group stands out among other Russian punk rock bands with strongly politicized song lyrics 
          and the promotion of a healthy lifestyle. All members of the band are vegetarians, abstain from alcohol, 
          drugs, and smoking. "Pornofilmy" was popular in Dubna in the early years of their performances, and after 
          the release of their fourth album, "In the Range Between Desperation and Hope," and the cancellation of several 
          concerts at the insistence of local authorities, the band gained significant recognition and became one of the leading 
          punk performers in Russia. Currently, "Pornofilmy" has 13 releases, including 8 studio albums and 5 mini-albums. 
          Their latest studio album, "This Will Pass," was released in 2020.

          The band's name is a metaphor for the surrounding reality, as stated by the vocalist Vladimir Kotlyarov in one of 
          the interviews: "the roads are terrible, salaries are meager, and people hang out in shopping centers without thinking about anything." 
          The band was founded in 2008, but the musicians actively started developing it only in 2012, after all members adopted vegetarianism and 
          gave up all harmful habits. This became the main theme of most of the band's lyrics at that time. All members of the group recorded their 
          music in the garage and initially mixed it themselves. Later, a friend of the band took care of the mastering for a symbolic fee. The first song, 
          "Come Over!" from the album "Russian Dream. Part I" in 2015, is dedicated to a fan of the band who committed suicide by jumping off the roof of his 
          house due to a lack of understanding and support in his environment.
        </p> 
        <p class="band-info__text">
          On February 24, 2022, after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the band expressed support for Ukraine. Vocalist Vladimir Kotlyarov stated, 
          "We are ashamed that our country behaves like an arrogant thug." The band members emigrated from Russia immediately after the start of the war. 
          In May-June 2022, they held 10 concerts with the band "Nerwy" and rapper Face, donating the proceeds to aid those affected. 
          On September 8, 2023, the Ministry of Justice of the Russian Federation included the leader of the rock band "PornoFilmy," Vladimir Kotlyarov, in the registry of foreign agents.
